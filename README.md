============================
In this game, you are a 2D character trapped in a 3D world trying to escape by solving puzzles.  

In order to start the game, run the main method from the "HostGame" class located in the MAIN package.
Once you enter your IP address and name a splash screen will appear and prompt you to press any key.

Now you are in the game, start exploring the hub level. Find keys corresponding to the level door you would like
to play.

When rotating in the game, the world seams to change but that is not the case. In actuality it is you
that is rotating and the world stays the same. However, a floor and ceiling will always appear the same
from the players perspective.  

Some doors in the game require more then one key in order to unlock. These doors need to be unlocked
simultaneously by the players. Furthermore, containers of the same color all hold the same item (if there
is such an item). This allows players to solve puzzles in creative ways.
